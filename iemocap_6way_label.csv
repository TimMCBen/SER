Ses04F_script02_1_F012,I just don't.  It's stupid.,angry,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M020,Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M021,Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,excited,train&valid

Ses04F_script02_1_M022,"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",frustrated,train&valid

Ses04F_script02_1_F014,What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,angry,train&valid

Ses04F_script02_1_F017,Yes.,angry,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M029,I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,frustrated,train&valid

Ses04F_script02_1_M034,Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,excited,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M035,No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,excited,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M036,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,excited,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M037,It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,excited,train&valid
Ses04F_script02_1_M038,They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,excited,train&valid

Ses04F_script02_2_M016,I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,frustrated,train&valid

Ses04F_impro05_M001,Did you file a complaint already?,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_F001,Yeah.  Yeah I did.,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M002,Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_F002,"I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M003,"Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-",frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_F003,Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.,frustrated,train&valid

Ses04F_impro05_M005,"Ma'am, I understand that.",frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_F005,it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,angry,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_F006,"because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",angry,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M006,"I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.",frustrated,train&valid

I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",angry,train&valid

Ses04F_impro05_M009,"I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.",frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_F011,Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,angry,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M010,What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M011,If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M012,We're just talking over each other.,frustrated,train&valid
Ses04F_impro05_M013,We're not going to communicate anything this way.,frustrated,train&valid

Ses02M_impro04_F003,"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",neutral,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_M005,"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_F004,"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",neutral,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_M006,"I don't know, I mean why - why",frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_M007,"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",frustrated,train&valid

Ses02M_impro04_M010,"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_F007,You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,neutral,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_M011,"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",frustrated,train&valid

Ses02M_impro04_M017,Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_F010,"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",neutral,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_F011,"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",neutral,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_F012,So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,neutral,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_M018,"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro04_M019,this doesn't happen to a normal person.,angry,train&valid

Ses02M_impro04_F015,"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",neutral,train&valid

Ses02M_impro05_M010,"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro05_M011,can they check there?,frustrated,train&valid
Ses02M_impro05_F012,"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",neutral,train&valid
